#Heythere! Appserver



##Install
Steps to make the server running like a horse. Unix Mac Osx Guide.

1. __install node.js__ http://nodejs.org/download/

2. __install couchdb__

3. __install redis__

4. __install dependencies__
clone this repo, cd into the folder, type `$ npm install`

5. __configure__ modify the config/development.js

##Start

```bash
$ node app.js
```
##Models
Yolo.Model is basiclly a Backbone.Model extended with validation and a couchdb layer. Models go into `app/models` and are loaded automaticlly if Yolo boots. 
You define a model by extending the Yolo.Model:
```js
	module.exports = Yolo.Model.extend({ 		
	//â€¦
	});
```
###Scaffolding
Generate Models easily with the generator.js . This would generate a model named "post" with attributes title, content and author and title would be required field.

```bash
$ node generate.js model post title:required content author
```

Find out more options via 
```bash 
$ node generate.js
```
###Defaults
Define Defaults for each attribute you will add to the later. Defaults can be anything like Strings, Numbers or Objects. If the attribute wont be overwritten the default value will be used instead. 
```js
defaults : {
	content : null
}
```

##Controllers
###Scaffolding
Generate Controllers easily with the generator.js . This would generate a controller namend "posts" with methods index, edit and delete. Method "edit" will be acessabble via 'POST' and "delete" via 'DELETE'. Routes to those methods will be added automatically.

```bash
$ node generate.js controller posts index edit:post delete:delete
```
